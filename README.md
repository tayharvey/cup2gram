# Cup2Gram Chrome extension
## Issue Description
The user needed a solution for converting recipe ingredient quantities in the browser. When using American recipes, quantities listed in cups needed to be converted to metric equivalents. Existing tools required user input for each individual quantity, a tedious process that led to user frustration.
## Desired Functionality
The user wanted the ability to view a recipe in the browser with the ingredient quantities converted automatically.
## Solution Documentation
A Chrome extension (Cup2Gram) was developed to achieve the desired functionality. Available in the Chrome Web Store, the extension automatically converts ingredient amounts and units on the webpage, as shown below (Figure 1).
